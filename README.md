# Getting-Web-Pages


Here the problem is to write a simple application program that
reads a URL from the command line, opens an InputStream from 
that URL, does the necessary filter chaining using the default 
encoding, and then use an appropriate read method to read 
successive characters from the file, each of which is printed 
out on System.out. That is, your program prints the raw data 
located at the URL; if the URL references an HTML file, the 
programâ€™s output is raw HTML.
